After adding the chart from plotly, scale the values to get them to a given range \
in the fig.layout, the range is set but when changed, it tends to favor a specific section but ignores the other sections. for example when set from 0 to 2000 then the area line is clearly shown but the other features dissapear due to the huge range yet the numbers are really small

after the function scales the data that is passed into it from the sidebar function, the get scaled function passes it into the get_radar_chart which is then used in the plotting
